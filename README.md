# Swirl

Swirl is a teaching tool for learning R, it comprises questions and answers and a bit of AI (for positive reinforcement).

## Important points

* **Install Swirl**
* **Download the units from Github**
* **Create a user ID that is your TC email address**

## Details

* Install the Swirl package by clicking the "packages" tab in the right hand pane and then clicking "install" or by typing `install.packages("swirl")` in the console window (located on the left hand side of the RStudio interface). 
* Once we have installed the package we need to turn it on, we do this by inputing the code `library(swirl)` - Swirl will tell you to type `swirl()` **but don't do that just yet!**
* First we need to load a lesson into Swirl, to do this cut and paste the following code into the console window (you will need to be connected to the internet):  
`install_course_github("core-methods-in-edm", "swirl", multi = TRUE)`
* Once the lesson finishes installing type `swirl()`, Swirl will then guide you through setting up a user ID, (please use your TC email address so we can identify you later). Choose the `Unit 1 - Introduction` course and the `Basic Building Blocks` lesson when you have the option.
* At the completion of the lesson you will submit your answers through a Google form. We will collect information on how many questions you answer, how many attempts you took to answer each question and the time you answered
